2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net A/fixp_clkdiv/fixp_clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin A/fixp_clkdiv/q_i_2/O, cell A/fixp_clkdiv/q_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net B/fixp_clkdiv/fixp_clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin B/fixp_clkdiv/q_i_2__0/O, cell B/fixp_clkdiv/q_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net C/fixp_clkdiv/fixp_clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin C/fixp_clkdiv/q_i_2__1/O, cell C/fixp_clkdiv/q_i_2__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net D/fixp_clkdiv/fixp_clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin D/fixp_clkdiv/q_i_2__2/O, cell D/fixp_clkdiv/q_i_2__2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT A/fixp_clkdiv/q_i_2 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
A/fixP_counter/dff_00/q_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT B/fixp_clkdiv/q_i_2__0 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
B/fixP_counter/dff_00/q_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT C/fixp_clkdiv/q_i_2__1 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
C/fixP_counter/dff_00/q_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#4 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT D/fixp_clkdiv/q_i_2__2 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
D/fixP_counter/dff_00/q_reg
Related violations: <none>
